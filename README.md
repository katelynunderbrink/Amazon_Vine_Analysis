# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine Program. I chose the Amazon Toys reviews. 

## Results

- Vine Reviews: 1266 
- Non- Vine Reviews: 62,028
- Vine 5 Star Reviews: 432
- Non-Vine 5 Star Reviews: 29,982
- Vine Percentage 5 star reviews: 34%
- Non-Vine Percentage 5 star reviews: 48%


## Summary
There does not seem to be a positivity bias for Vine reviews. An additional analysis can be done to see if the purchases were verified to rule out any false results.
